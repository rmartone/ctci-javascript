# Cracking the Coding Interview - Javascript Solutions

* Since 'Cracking the Coding Interview' mainly uses Java and C++, I wanted to work through problems myself using modern Javascript and Jest.
* My solutions often differ from the book. I tried to improve on clarity and brevity without sacrificing efficiency.
* This is a work in progress, and I plan to post more solutions in the coming weeks as time permits.
* If you have suggestions on how to improve anything, I'd love to hear from you!
