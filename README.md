# Cracking the Coding Interview - Javascript Solutions

* This work in progress is my attempt to work through problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview" using modern Javascript and Jest.
* Out of courtesy to the book's author I intentionally removed comments relating to the problems.
* If you have suggestions on how to improve anything, let me know!
