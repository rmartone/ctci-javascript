# Cracking the Coding Interview - Javascript Solutions

* This work in progress is my attempt to solve the problems from "Cracking the Coding Interview" using modern Javascript and Jest.
* I've intentionally removed comments relating to the problems out of courtesy for the book's author.
* If you have suggestions on how to improve anything, let me know!
